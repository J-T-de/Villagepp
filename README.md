# Village++

Open Source Village Editor for Firefly Studios' Stronghold Crusader

## Project

In Firefly Studio's [Stronghold Crusader](https://fireflyworlds.com/games/strongholdcrusader/), enemy AI build their own castles specified in an aiv file (the v stands for village). Firefly released a set of [modding utilities](https://stronghold.heavengames.com/cgi-bin/forum/display.cgi?action=ct&f=4,3820,,10) including a tool to modify these aiv files. The goal of this project is to make a new editor with more features. The aiv file format is documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/J-T-de/Villagepp/wiki).
